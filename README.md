This takes sysmon logs and builds a process tree in Neo4j.

Usage of this tool is to build process spawning trees. Currently you have to export the operational log from sysmon as an xml file and then dump that file into the tool

Usage of this Requires neo4j in order for usage. Going to automate the creation of sysmon project db in neo4j
