# Sysmon-Visualizer
This takes sysmon data and visualizes process trees. Made with Neo4j

Quick side note for next time I work on this
Each Child should only have one relationship
A parent can have multiple relationships to children but a child can have only one relationship to a parent
This should fix the issue I was encountering earlier
