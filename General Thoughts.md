# The Filters
- Time
- Machine
- Process(Guid)

# Node Summary
Gonna be a box in one corrner giving all the data in a more presentable format\
Link to VT with display of detection(enable by filter setting)

Quick side note for next time I work on this
Each Child should only have one relationship
A parent can have multiple relationships to children but a child can have only one relationship to a parent
This should fix the issue I was encountering earlier


## TODO/Thoughts
Depending on what is returned from the rest of the event IDs, I could add other relationships that map to the guid
Filtering
Process Termination Marking
Getting Data straight From a log in real time
Integration with splunk(if at all possible)
